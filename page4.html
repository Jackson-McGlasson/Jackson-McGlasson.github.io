            <p class="p1">One of my best high school experiences was being on the school cross country team. I have been a decent runner since I was young and after middle school it was suggested I join the team. At first it was just a good way to get exercise and have something to do. However, as I put more time and hard work in with my teammates, it became an important part of my life. I made friendships and grew in confidence of my own abilities. Racing against one hundred people can be very excited. I never won the whole thing, but what I did was improve my own performance and become a better athlete. The team itself was a good source of comraderie and for building relationships with my teammates mode it all the more fun. This team helped me hone my dedication, leadership, and teamwork skills.</p>
