            <p>This assignment was to make three different portraits of a famous person using color shading. One of them is a regular portait, one in a pop art style, and one is monocromatic.</p>

            <p>I choose to make my portrait of Neil Degrasse Tyson, a famous astrophysicist and science educator. I admire his spirit for scientific advancement and his ability to understand and explain complex things to others. This project was fun because I created art that I am proud of. I enjoyed learning new skills in working with adobe illustrator and honing my skills</p>
