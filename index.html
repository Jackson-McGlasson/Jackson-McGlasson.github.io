            <p class="p1"> I am Jackson McGlasson, and I am an App Academy student at Pasadena High School. I am very interested in science, which is why I am going to be going to UC San Diego studying Biochemistry. I like math, science, and nature. I enjoy the logic and problem solving associated with working math. I'm excited to expand my skills and learn new things. The discoveries of science fascinate me as. I love to learn more about how the world works. I am also a runner and I spent four years on my cross country team, which was a great experience. I like to get out and explore nature, by hiking or going to the beach. It is a great way to feel calm and ready to do more. What I enjoy most is learning new things. I like building my skills and learning new facts to better myself.</p>
